# FDTDream

> This README is not finished. There are a lot more features to FDTDream.

FDTDream is a Python package designed to streamline the process of working with Lumerical FDTD simulations. Built on Lumerical's native Python API, FDTDream simplifies the creation and modification of simulation objects with a more intuitive and manageable syntax. Unlike the native API, FDTDream offers comprehensive auto-completion, well-structured documentation, and additional custom objects like lattices and regular polygons, making it significantly easier to use.

## Installation  

To use FDTDream, you must have **Lumerical FDTD** installed on your computer, along with a valid license and the correct path to Lumerical's Python API.  

### 1. Install FDTDream  
Run the following command:  
```cmd
pip install fdtdream
```

### 2. Set the Lumerical API path
To permanently set the location of Lumericalâ€™s lumapi.py file, run:
```python
from FDTDream import set_lumapi_location

set_lumapi_location("path_to_lumapi.py")
```
This needs to be done only once, as it updates the default search path for lumapi.py. Unless you reinstall or update FDTDream, no further action is required.

To get the currently set path, use:
```python
from FDTDream import get_lumapi_location

print(get_lumapi_location())
```

### Default *lumapi.py* location
By default, lumapi.py is typically found at:
```cmd
C:\Program Files\Lumerical\v241\api\python\lumapi.py
```
> Note: The v241 folder name may vary depending on your Lumerical installation version.

## Autocompletion and documentation
One of FDTDream's key features is its powerful auto-completion and structured documentation. Lumerical's FDTD desktop application has a complex interface with deeply nested menus and options, which can be difficult to translate into a pure Python workflow. FDTDream addresses this challenge by organizing simulation objects into well-structured submodules that closely mirror the original application's hierarchy. This design makes navigation intuitive and enables users to explore available options efficiently. To facilitate this, FDTDream leverages auto-completion, allowing users to "scroll" through available properties and methods instead of memorizing their locations.

For instance, adding an FDTD Region and modifying its boundary conditions is as simple as:
```python
from fdtdream import FDTDream

# Create a new simulation
sim = FDTDream.new_simulation("test_simulation")

# Add an FDTD Region
fdtd = sim.add.simulation.fdtd_region()
fdtd.settings.boundary_conditions.boundaries.set_boundary_types(
    x_min="anti_symmetric", x_max="anti-symmetric",
    y_min="symmetric", y_max="symmetric"
)
```

While this structure may seem extensive, auto-completion eliminates the need to remember exact method locations. Additionally, all methods come with clear documentation, including input variables, types, and explanations of how each setting affects the simulation.

In practice, auto-completion hints will appear as follows:

## Creating Simulations

FDTDream provides three ways to handle simulation environments:

1. Creating a new simulation file
2. Loading an existing simulation file
3. Using an existing simulation file as a base while saving to a different file

Regardless of the approach, start by importing the FDTDream object. This is the only import you need:
```python
from fdtdream import FDTDream
```

### Creating a new simulation
To create a new simulation, use:
```python
sim = FDTDream.new_simulation()
```

If no arguments are provided, a file explorer will prompt you to select a name and location for the simulation file. When running the program the console will display the following message:
```cmd
Replace the new_simulation() call with this to do exactly the same without calling the file explorer.

sim = FDTDream.new_simulation(r'selected_save_path.fsp', units='nm', hide=False)
```

- The first argument is the location and name of the new file, and if it's provided, the file explorer doesn't appear. 
- The **units** argument defines what units all length values will be interpreted in, and is in nanometers by default. 
- The **hide** argument decides wether the Lumerical application should open or run in the background. 

### Loading an existing simulation
To load an existing simulation file, use:
```python
sim = FDTDream.load_simulation()
```
If no file path is provided, the file explorer will prompt you to select a file. When a simulation is loaded, FDTDream analyzes its contents and reconstructs the corresponding Python objects. After loading, the program terminates and prints type annotations to the console.

For example, if your simulation contains an FDTD Region, a circle, and a rectangle, the console output will look like this:

```cmd
Replace the load_simulation() call with this to do exactly the same without calling the file explorer.

sim = FDTDream.load_simulation(r'path_that_you_loaded_from.fsp', 
	units='nm', hide=True)

# region TYPE ANNOTATIONS

fdtd: FDTDream.i.FDTDRegion = getattr(sim, '_fdtd')
rectangle: FDTDream.i.Rectangle = getattr(sim, 'rectangle')
circle: FDTDream.i.Circle = getattr(sim, 'circle')

# endregion TYPE ANNOTATIONS
```
Copy and paste these lines into your Python script, replacing the original method call. This ensures full control over the simulation objects with complete auto-completion support. Once loaded, you can modify the simulation as follows:

```python
sim = FDTDream.load_simulation(r'path_that_you_loaded_from.fsp', 
	units='nm', hide=True)

# region TYPE ANNOTATIONS

fdtd: FDTDream.i.FDTDRegion = getattr(sim, '_fdtd')
rectangle: FDTDream.i.Rectangle = getattr(sim, 'rectangle')
circle: FDTDream.i.Circle = getattr(sim, 'circle')

# endregion TYPE ANNOTATIONS

rectangle.x_span = 500  # Change width of rectangle to 500 nm
circle.settings.material.set_material("Au (Gold) - Johnson and Christy")  # Change the circle's material.

# Save the simulation.
sim.save()

```
Additionally, FDTDream updates its internal material register based on the loaded simulation file, enabling auto-completion for material-related settings. Calling `sim.save()` overwrites the existing file unless a different save path is provided.

> Note: Loading simulation files not created with FDTDream may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. While most structures, monitors, and sources should load correctly, groups might not be properly interpreted unless they were originally created within FDTDream.

### Loading simulation files as base environments
A useful feature of FDTDream is the ability to load a predefined simulation environment as a starting point for a new simulation. For example, you can create a base simulation file in the Lumerical FDTD desktop application, customize it with materials or settings, and then use it as a template. When you load this base file in FDTDream, your new simulation is saved to a different location, ensuring the original remains unchanged. To create a new simulation using a predefined base, run:

```python
sim = FDTDream.load_base()

```
This works exactly like `load_simulation()`, but prompts for two file selections:

1. The first prompt selects the base simulation file.
2. The second prompt specifies where the modified simulation should be saved.

### Saving simulation files
Simulation files are automatically saved to the location specified in the `new_simulation()`, `load_simulation()`, or `load_base()` methods when calling the `sim.save()` method.
You can also specify a custom save path by passing that as the only argument to the method.
## Structures

FDTDream supports not all, but most of the structure types present in the Lumerical FDTD desktop application.

**Lumerical FDTD native structure types**:
- Rectangle
- Circle
- Sphere
- Ring
- Pyramid
- Polygon
- Structure Group

Custom FDTDream structure types:
- Regular Polygon
- Lattice
- Triangle

All structures can be added to a simulation using the methods found in the `sim.add.structures` module. Each method initializes a specific structure type, adds it to the simulation, and returns a python object corresponding to the structure. All subsequent modifications of the structure is done through this returned object.

```python
# Create a rectangle structure.
rectangle = sim.add.structures.rectangle("rectangle")  # No keyword arguments -> rectangle with default values. Def. position is (0, 0, 0).

# Create a circles tructure.
circle = sim.add.structures.circle("circle")  # Creates a default circle
```
The first argument all methods in the `sim.add.structures` module is the name of the structure. 
This is the only argument you must provide, however, each structure type as it's own set of keyword arguments that allow the user to set the structure's properties already in the initializing method. The keyword arguments are auto-complete compatible, and is listed in the documentation of each method.
>In the Lumerical FDTD desktop application, several structures can share the same name, however, this makes it very difficult to modify the correct objects through the Lumerical API. Therefore, all object created by FDTDream must have a unique name. If not, an error will be raised.



```python
rectangle_2 = sim.add.structures.rectangle("rectangle 2", 
                                           x=100, y=100, z=0, 
                                           x_span=500, y_span=200, z_span=100, 
                                           rot_vec=(0, 0, 1), rot_angle=45,
                                           material="Au (Gold) - Johnson and Christy")
```

All structures objects have a set of properties that can be directly modified. Some of these properties are shared between the different types, while some are unique to the specific structure type. Here's some examples:

```python
# Change x span to 400 nm and increase z span by 10 nm
rectangle.x_span = 400
rectangle.z_span += 200

# Disable the structure
rectangle.enabled = False

# Move the structure 100 nm in negative x-direction
rectangle.x -= 100

# Double the radius of the circle's y-radius
circle.radius_2 *= 2
```

All structures have a `settings` module with submodules that corresponds to the setting tabs in the desktop application. These are:
- geometry
- material
- rotation

### Geometry

The geometry module contains four methods. One of these sets the dimensions of the structure. Here, the user only provides the properties they want to change. Any properties not passed to the method remains unchanged. The other three sets the structure's position. One sets it using regular cartesian coordinates, the second using cyllindrical coordinates, and the third using spherical coordinates.

**Examples:**
```python
# Set dimensions through the geometry module.
rectangle.settings.geometry.set_dimensions(x_span=400, y_span=100)
circle.settings.geometry.set_dimensions(radius=100, radius_2=200, z_span=100)


# Set position using cartesian coordinates.
rectangle.settings.geometry.set_position(x=10, y=0, z=100)  # Define directly
rectangle.settings.geometry.set_position(*circle.pos)  # Set position to the same as the circle structure.

# Set position cyllindrically using the position of the circle as the origin.
rectangle.settings.geometry.set_position_cylindrically(origin=circle, theta=45, radius=100)

# Set the position spherically using the position of the circle as the origin.
rectangle.settings.geometry.set_position_spherically(origin=circle, theta=130, phi=45, radius=100)
```

> For those confused with the `set_position(*circle.pos)` statement: 
> The asterix (**\***) represents the **unpacking operator** in python. When placed in front of an iterable, such as a list or a tuple, it unpacks its contents. In this case, where `circle.pos` returns a three element tuple ie. (1, 2, 3), the asterisk unpacks the tuple making the statement identical to `set_position(1, 2, 3)`.

### rotation

The rotation module naturaly governs the rotation state of the structure. It contains three methods:

#### set_rotation():

Arguments are:
-rot_vec: Three element tuple representing a vector the structure is rotated around. (0, 0, 1) would be the z-axis. You can also pass in "x", "y", or "z" for the major axes.
-rot_angle: The rotation angle in degrees. Rotation is counterclockwise around the rotation vector.
-rot_point: Three element tuple representing the coordinate the rotation vector passes through. Can also be another simulation object. In that case, it's position coordinate is used. If not provided, the obejct's own position coordinate is used.

Applies a rotation from the unrotated state. Ie. if the rotation was 45 degrees around the z-axis, and you call `set_rotation(rot_vec="z", rot_angle=50)`, the new rotation state is 50 degrees around the z-axis.

#### rotate():
Same arguments as `set_rotation()`. Applies a rotation from the current rotation state. Ie. if the rotation was 45 degrees around the x-axis, and you call `set_rotation(rot_vec="z", rot_angle=45)`, the new rotation state is 90 degrees around the z-axis. This method returns a reference to the method itself, allowing the user to stack multiple rotation operations, ie.
```python
# Apply 45 degree rotation around the x-axis, then around the y-axis, then the z-axis.
rectangle.settings.rotation.rotate("x", 45)("y", 45)("z", 45)
```
